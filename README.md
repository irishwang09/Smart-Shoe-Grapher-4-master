# Smart Shoe Grapher
Android App that graphs real time data from smart shoe sensors over UDP wifi

Features Include:

1. Real Time graphing of 6 sensors over UDP wifi
2. User input UDP Settings to allow connection to any remote server*

*Note: Graphing uses an implementation that depends on a restrictive Server/Client communication protocol...Therefore this application won't work currently with any sensors. It will work only with sensors that send out properly formatted UDP packets
